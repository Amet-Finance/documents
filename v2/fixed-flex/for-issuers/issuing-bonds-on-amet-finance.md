### Step-by-Step Guide to Issuing Bonds

#### Step 1: Define Your Bond Parameters

In this initial step, you'll set the foundational aspects of your bond. Each parameter is crucial in shaping how your bond will function and appeal to potential investors. Here's what you need to define:

* **Total Bonds**: Specify the total number of bonds you're issuing. This number can be adjusted later if the contract has not yet settled. After [settlement](../glossary.md), you can only decrease the number of bonds, providing flexibility in managing your issuance based on investor demand and other factors.
* **Maturity Period**: Define the period after which the bond will mature, and investors can claim their returns. You can set this period in minutes, hours, days, or even specific block numbers. While you can specify the time in conventional units for ease, it will be converted and stored on the blockchain in blocks, ensuring precision and alignment with blockchain operations.
* **Chain**: Select the blockchain network on which you want to issue your bond. This choice determines where your bond will live and be traded, impacting its accessibility and the community of potential investors.
* **Purchase Token/Amount**: Choose the token and amount that investors will use to purchase the bond. This sets the entry price for investors and the currency in which you'll raise capital.
* **Payout Token/Amount**: Determine the token and the amount that will be paid out at the end of the maturity period. This decision defines the return investors will receive, an essential factor in attracting potential buyers for your bond.

#### Step 5(Optional): Settling the Contract

Once your bond has attracted investors and you've accumulated the required payout amount, it's time to settle the contract. This critical step solidifies the bond's terms and showcases your commitment to fulfilling the obligations, significantly boosting investor confidence.

* **Secure Investment**: By settling the bond in the Manage tab, you signal to investors that the bond is a secure investment, as the necessary funds are locked and allocated for the bond payouts.
* **Flexibility**: Even after settlement, you retain the ability to decrease the bond supply if the total issued amount is more than you require, allowing you to withdraw any excess payout. This ensures your funds are not unnecessarily tied up.

#### Step 6(Optional): Update the Bond Description

Transparency and clear communication are key to attracting and retaining investors. The bond page on Amet Finance features a section where you can provide a title and detailed description of the bond.

* **Informative Title**: Choose a title that succinctly captures the essence of the bond, making it easier for potential investors to understand what the bond offers at a glance.
* **Detailed Description**: In the description, elaborate on how the bond works and what investors can expect. This could include the use of the raised capital, expected returns, and any other relevant information that would help investors make informed decisions.
