Issuing a bond on Amet Finance involves defining your bond parameters (amount, interest rate, maturity period, etc.), creating the bond on the platform, and launching it to potential investors. The process is designed to be straightforward, guiding issuers at every step.

### 3. What fees are involved in issuing bonds?

Issuers are subject to three main fees: a fixed issuance fee, a purchase fee percentage from each bond sold, and a capitulation redeem fee for early redemptions. Check the issue page for the most up-to-date fee details.

### 4. Can I modify my bond after issuance?

Post-issuance, certain bond parameters cannot be altered to ensure trust and stability for investors. However, issuers can manage bond supply and withdraw excess payouts from capitulation redeem fees.
