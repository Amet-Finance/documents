In case of issuer default, when the bond matures without full payout:

3. **Community Decision**: Investors may choose to give the issuer more time if there's potential for future payout.
4. **Secondary Market**: If preferred, you can trade your bond on secondary markets.

Defaults are rare, but we advise thorough research before investing to mitigate risks.
